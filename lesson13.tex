\section{Ring of Fractions}



Throughout this section, $A \neq \{0\}$ is a commutative ring. The aim of this section is to prove that the commutative ring $A$ is always a subring of a larger ring $Q$ in which every non-zero element that is not a zero divisor is invertible. We had already proved that if $a$ is not a zero divisor nor zero, then $ab = ac$ in $A$ implies that $b = c$. Then a non-zero divisor element has similar properties to invertible elements.

The construction of $\mathbb{Q}$ is usually based on the construction of $\mathbb{Q}$ based on $\mathbb{Z}$. For this, note that every rational number may be represented in many different ways as the quotient of two integers, i.e.,
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \quad \text{iff} \quad ad = bc.
\]
The relation
\[
(a, b) \sim (c, d) \quad \text{iff} \quad ad = bc,
\]
is an equivalence relation over the set $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$. The fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ is the equivalence class under $\sim$. Then $\mathbb{Q}$ is defined as the set of all equivalence classes, and the operations of addition and multiplication are given by
\[
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}, \quad \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}.
\]

These operations are independent of the choice of representatives of the equivalence classes and make $\mathbb{Q}$ a field. The following theorem is a generalization of the above construction for any commutative ring.

\begin{teo} 
Let $A$ be an integral domain. Then the set $D = A \setminus \{0\}$ is a non-empty subset of $A$ that does not contain any zero divisors, and there is a field $Q$ such that
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item $A$ is embedded in $Q$ as a subring.
    \item Every element of $D$ is invertible in $Q$.
    \item (Uniqueness of $Q$) Up to isomorphism, $Q$ is the smallest field containing $A$ in which all the elements of $D$ are invertible.
\end{enumerate}
\end{teo}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Let $T = A \times D$ and define the equivalence relation (this is left as an exercise for the reader) $\sim$ on $T$ by
        \[
        (a, b) \sim (c, d) \iff ad = bc.
        \]
        We denote the equivalence class of $(a, b)$ by $\frac{a}{b}$, i.e.,
        \[
        \frac{a}{b} = \{(c, d) \in T \mid (a, b) \sim (c, d)\}.
        \]
    
        Let's define $Q$ as the set of all the equivalence classes defined above, that is,
        \[
        Q = \left\{\frac{a}{b} \mid (a, b) \in T \right\}.
        \]
        Then $Q$ is a commutative ring with unit with the operations given by
        \[
        \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}, \quad \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}.
        \]
    
        Note that the unit of $Q$ is $\frac{e}{e}$, for any $e \in D$, and $\frac{b}{a}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $\frac{a}{b} \in Q$. Since we have already constructed $Q$, we need to embed $A$ into $Q$. For this, we define the ring homomorphism
        \[
        \eta : A \to Q, \quad a \mapsto \frac{ad}{d},
        \]
        where $d$ is any element of $D$ (it's an exercise to prove that $\eta$ is an injective ring homomorphism which is well-defined, i.e., $\eta$ does not depend on the choice of $d \in D$).
    
        \item Let's prove that each $b \in D$ has a multiplicative inverse (under the embedding $\phi$) in $Q$. The element $b$ is represented in $Q$ under $\phi$ by $\frac{bd}{d}$ for any $d \in D$. Then its multiplicative inverse in $Q$ is the fraction $\frac{d}{bd}$. This fact is easy to prove since $A$ is commutative and
        \[
        \frac{bd}{d} \cdot \frac{d}{bd} = \frac{bd \cdot d}{bd^2} = 1 \quad \text{in } Q.
        \]
    
        \item Considering ii), to prove that $Q$ is the smallest ring containing $A$ in which all the elements of $D$ become invertible, is equivalent to proving that, if $R$ is any commutative ring with unit, and
        \[
        \kappa : A \to R
        \]
        is an injective homomorphism such that $\kappa(d)$ is invertible in $R$ for any $d \in D$, then there is an injective homomorphism $\theta : Q \to R$ such that $\theta \circ \eta = \kappa$.
    
        Let $\kappa : A \to R$ be any injective homomorphism such that $\kappa(d)$ is invertible in $R$ for any $d \in D$. Extend $\kappa$ to the well-defined injective ring homomorphism (this is left as an exercise):
        \[
        \theta : Q \to R, \quad \frac{a}{b} \mapsto \kappa(a)(\kappa(b))^{-1}.
        \]
        Then for any $a \in A$ and any $e \in D$:
        \[
        \theta \circ \eta(a) = \theta(\eta(a)),
        \]
        \[
        = \theta\left(\frac{ae}{e}\right),
        \]
        \[
        = \kappa(ae)(\kappa(e))^{-1},
        \]
        \[
        = \kappa(a)\kappa(e)(\kappa(e))^{-1},
        \]
        \[
        = \kappa(a).
        \]
    
        Therefore, $\theta \circ \eta = \kappa$, completing the proof.
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
    
    The field $Q$ is called the field of fractions of $A$.
    
    \begin{exa}[9.4]
    If $A$ is a field, then its field of fractions is just $A$ itself.
    \end{exa}
    
    \begin{exa}[9.5]
    $\mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain whose field of fractions is $\mathbb{Q}$. The subring $2\mathbb{Z}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ has no zero divisors but has no unit, and its field of fractions is also $\mathbb{Q}$.
    \end{exa}

\subsection{Ring Homomorphisms}

To understand better rings and their properties we have to look at maps between ring that preserve the structure, namely that preserve both addition and multiplication.
This maps are called ring-homomorphisms.

\begin{defi}
    Let \(A\) and \(B\) be rings.
    A map \(\psi\colon A\to B\)  is a \textbf{ring-homomorphism} if, for all \(a,b\in A\),
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \(\varphi(a+b)=\varphi(a)+\varphi(b)\), and
    \item \(\psi(a\cdot b) = \psi(a)\psi(b)\).
\end{enumerate}
A   bijective ring-homomorphism is called a \textbf{ring-isomorphism}. 
If there is an isomorphism between \(A\) and \(B\), we say these rings are isomorphic, which is denoted by \(A\cong B\).
\end{defi}

Note that condition (i) means \(\psi\) is a group-homomorphism from \((A,+_A)\) to \((B,+_B)\).
This implies that \(\psi(0_A) = 0_B\) since \(\psi(0_A) = \psi(0_A+0_A) = \psi(0_A) + \psi(0_A)\) whence \(\psi(0_A) = 0_B\) by substraction.
A ring-homomorphism from \(A\) to \(A\) is called an \textbf{endomorphism} of \(A\).

\begin{rem}
    If both \(A\) and \(B\) are rings with unity, a ring-homomorphism  \(\psi\colon A\to B\) must in addition satisfy \(\psi(1_A) = 1_B\).
\end{rem}

Given a homomorphism of rings \(\psi\colon A\to B\), the kernel of \(\psi\) is 
\[\operatorname{Ker}\psi =\{x \in A \mid \varphi(x)=0\}.\]
The image of \(\psi\) is \(\im \psi = \psi(A) \).

\begin{eje}
    Prove \(\ker\psi\) is an ideal of \(A\) and \(\im\psi \) is a subring of \(B\). Why is it not necessarily true that \(\im\psi \) is an ideal  of \(B\)?
\end{eje}

\begin{exa}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item If \(B\) is a subring of a ring \(A\), the canonical injection \(\iota \colon B\to A\colon b\mapsto b\) is a ring-homomorphism.
In particular, the identity \(\text{Id}_A\colon A\to A\) is an isomorphism.

\item If \(A\) is a ring and \(I\trianglelefteq A\) an ideal, the canonical projection \(\pi \colon A\to A/I\) is a surjective homomorphism of rings.
Indeed,  we have 
\begin{align*}
    \pi (a_1) + \pi (a_2) & = (a_1 + I) + (a_2 + I)
                    = (a_1 + a_2) + I
                    = \pi (a_1 + a_2), \quad\text{and}\\
    \pi (a_1) \pi (a_2)   & = (a_1 + I)(a_2 + I)
                     = (a_1 a_2) + I 
                     = \pi (a_1 a_2).
\end{align*}
    

In particular, the projection  \(\Z\to \Z/ n\Z\) is a ring homomorphism, called \textbf{reduction modulo} \(n\).

\item If \((A_\lambda)_{\lambda\in \Lambda}\) is a family of rings, the \(\alpha\)th canonical projection \(p_\alpha \colon \prod_{\lambda\in \Lambda} A_\lambda\to A_\alpha\) is a surjective ring-homomorphism.
\item The rings \( 2\mathbb{Z} \) and \( 3\mathbb{Z} \) are not isomorphic. If there were an isomorphism
\(
\psi: 2\mathbb{Z} \to 3\mathbb{Z}
\)
such that \( \psi(2) = 3k \) for some integer  \( k \neq 0 \), then
\[
\psi(4) = \psi(2 + 2) = \psi(2) + \psi(2) = 6k,
\]
but
\[
\psi(4) = \psi(2 \cdot 2) = \psi(2) \cdot \psi(2) = 9k^2.
\]
Thus
\(
6k = 9k^2,
\)
and since \( k \neq 0 \), then \( 2 = 3k \), which is impossible. 
Therefore \( 2\mathbb{Z} \ncong 3\mathbb{Z} \).

\item Let \( A \) be a commutative ring with unity, then the map
\[
\psi: A[x] \to A\quad: \quad p(x) \mapsto  p(0)
\]
is a ring homomorphism that maps a polynomial to its constant term.
In general, the evaluation map \(\psi_\alpha: A[x]\to A\) defined by 
\[
\psi_\alpha\left(a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_nx^n\right) = a_0 + a_1\alpha + \cdots + a_n\alpha^n,
\] 
where \(\alpha\in A\) is fixed,  is a homomorphism of \( A[x] \) onto \( A \). 

\item There is no ring homomorphism \( \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) for any \( n \in \Z^+ \).
\end{enumerate}
\end{exa}

\subsection{Properties of Ring Homomorphisms}

\begin{prop}
Let \(\psi\colon A\to B\) be a morphism of rings.
Then
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item \( f(-a) = -f(a) \) for all \(a\in A\)
\item \( f(na) = nf(a) \)  for all \(a\in A\) and \(n\in \Z\)
\item \( f(a^n) = f(a)^n \)  for all \(a\in A\) and \(n\in \Z^+\)

\item \(\ker \psi \) is an ideal of \(A\)
\item \(\im \psi\) is a subring of \(B\)
\item \(\psi\) is injective if and only of \(\ker \psi = 0\)
\item if \(a\in A\) is invertible, so is \(\psi(a)\)
\item if \(\mathfrak{p}\) is an ideal of \(B\), then \(\psi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})\) is an ideal of \(A\).
\item if \(\mathfrak{p}\) is a maximal (prime) ideal of \(B\), then \(\psi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})\) is a maximal (prime) ideal of \(A\).
\item the composition of ring homomorphisms is a ring homomorphism
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Straight from the definitions and left as an exercise to the student.

\subsection{Fundamental Theorems of Isomorphism}

The proofs of the following results  are left as exercises to the reader.
The diagrams should be used as mnemoteniques.

\begin{teo}[Fundamental Theorem on Ring-Homomorphisms]
    Let  $\psi : A \to B$ be a ring-homomorphism   and $I$   an ideal of $A$ with \(I\subseteq \ker \psi\).
    Then    there is a unique ring-homomorphism $\overline{\psi}\colon A/I \to B$ such that \(\psi = \overline{\psi}\circ \pi\), i.e.,  $$\overline{\psi}(a + I) = \psi(a)\quad\text{for all }a \in A.$$
    In other words, such that  the following diagram commutes \[
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep={3em}]
A \arrow[r, "\psi"] \arrow[d, "\pi"'] & B \\
A/I \arrow[ru, dashed, "\overline{\psi}"'] &
\end{tikzcd}
\]
    Moreover
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item $\operatorname{Im} \overline{\psi} = \operatorname{Im} \psi$,
        \item $\ker \overline{\psi} = (\ker \psi)/I$
        \item $\overline{\psi}$ is an isomorphism if and only if $\psi$ is an epimorphism and $I = \ker \psi$.
    \end{enumerate}  
\end{teo}

\begin{proof}[Proof (Sketch)]
    Define \(\overline{\psi}\colon A/I\to B\) by \(\overline{\psi}(a+I) = \psi(a)\).
    By using the fact that  \(I\subseteq \ker \psi\), we show \(\overline{\psi}\) is well-defined.
    This shows the existence.
    If \(\varphi\colon A/I\to B\) is another ring-homomorphism such that \(\psi = \varphi\circ \pi\), then 
    \(\overline{\psi}\circ \pi = \varphi\circ\pi\).
    Since \(\pi\) is surjective, it has a right inverse and thus  \(\overline{\psi}  = \varphi\).
    This shows the uniqueness.
    On the other hand, (i) $\psi(a) \in \operatorname{Im} \psi$ if and only if $\psi(a) = \overline{\psi}(a+I) \in \operatorname{Im} \overline{\psi}$. Hence $\operatorname{Im} \psi = \operatorname{Im} \overline{\psi}$. Note (ii)    \begin{align*}
        \ker \overline{\psi} &= \{a +I\in A/I \mid \overline{\psi}(a+I) = 0\} \\
        &= \{a+I \in A/I \mid \psi(a) = 0\} \\
        &= \{a+I \in A/I \mid a \in \ker \psi\} \\
        &= \ker \psi / I
        \end{align*}
    Finally, (i) shows \(\overline{\psi}\) is surjective if and only if \(\psi\) is, and (ii) implies \(\overline{\psi}\) is injective if \(\ker\psi = I\) since \(\ker\overline{\psi} = I/I = I\).
    These facts imply (iii).
\end{proof}

The following corollaries are known as the fundamental theorems of ring-homomorphisms.
Their proof follows from the fundamental theorem of ring-homomorphisms and thus we leave the details to the reader.



\begin{cor}[Second Isomorphism Theorem]
    Let $I$ and $J$ be ideals in a ring $A$.
    Then \[\frac{I}{I\cap J} \cong \frac{I+J}{J}.\]
\end{cor}


\begin{cor}[Third Isomorphism Theorem]
    Let $I$ and $J$ be ideals in a ring $A$ with \(J\subseteq I\).
    Then \[\frac{A/J}{I / J} \cong \frac{A}{I}.\]
\end{cor}

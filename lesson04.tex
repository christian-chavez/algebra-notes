\section{The dihedral group}

Objects have bilateral
symmetry if they look the same when flipped over (usually in a specific direction, say vertically).
The easiest geometric examples of objects
with both rotational and bilateral symmetry are regular polygons.

Observe that is not necessary to track the movement of all the points that make up a  polygon in order to describe a rigid motion. 
Instead, we can simply keep track of their vertices.
This motivates  an important example of groups.

Some definitions first.
A permutation of a set \(X\) is a bijection from \(X\) onto \(X\).
A regular polygon with $n$ sides is called an $n$-gon.
A symmetry of the \(n\)-gon is any rigid motion of of the \(n\)-gon.
To be precise,  a symmetry of the \(n\)-gon is just a permutation of \(\left\{ 1,\ldots, n \right\}\). From now and on, we will denote \([n] = \left\{ 1,\ldots, n \right\}\).

It turns out, we can associate a group to the \(n\)-gon to study its rigid motions, that is, its symmetries.
It is called the dihedral group of order \(2n\) and denoted \(D_{2n}\).
Dihedral groups describe objects that have both rotational and bilateral symmetry.

% For example, 

\begin{exa}
    Both rotations and horizontal flips respect the shape of an equilateral triangle.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{triangle-rotation.png}
    % \caption{}%\label{fig:}
\end{figure}

The first symmetry is decribed by the permutation \(\sigma\colon [3]\to [3]\) defined by 
\[\sigma(1)=2,\quad\sigma(2)=3,\quad \sigma(3) = 1.\]

The second one is described by \(\tau\colon [3]\to [3]\) where 
\[\tau(1)=1,\quad\tau(2)=3,\quad \tau(3) = 2.\]
\end{exa}

\begin{rem}
    We choose the notation \(D_{2n}\) because there are \(2n\) symmetries associated to a \(n\)-gon. Namely, \(n\) rotations and \(n\) reflections.
\end{rem}

\begin{teo}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \(\left\{ 1,r,r^2,\ldots,r^{n-1} \right\}\) are all distinct. Also  \(r^n = 1\) and \(|r| = n\).
    \item \(|s| =2\)
    \item \(s\neq r^i\) for all \(i\in [n]_0\).
    \item \(sr^i = sr^j \) for all \(i,j\in [n-1]\) with \(i\neq j\).
    \item \(rs = sr^{-1}\)
    \item \(r^i s = sr^{-i}\) for all \(0\leq i\leq n\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{teo}

\begin{eje}
    Prove or disprove \((sr^9) (sr^6) = r^9\).
\end{eje}


\section{Permutations and the symmetric group}


\begin{rem}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Not all permutations are cycles.
        \item 
        \item Algorithm to factor a permutation into the product of cycles.
        \item Every permutation has a cycle decomposition.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{rem}


\begin{defi}
    
\end{defi}


\begin{lem}
    Disjoint permutations commute.
\end{lem}


\begin{lem}
    Every permutation of \([n]\) is either a cycle or a product of disjoint cycles.
\end{lem}

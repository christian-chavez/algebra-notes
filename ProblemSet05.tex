\begin{questions}
\question
Let $A$ be a ring. The center of $A$ is defined as
\[
C(A) = \{a \in A \mid \forall x \in A : ax = xa\}.
\]
Prove that $C(A)$ is a subring of $A$.

\question
We say that a proper ideal $I$ of $R$ is maximal if there exists no other proper ideal $J$ of $R$ properly containing $I$. Let $I = \langle n \rangle$ be a principal ideal in $\mathbb{Z}$. Show that $I$ is maximal if and only if $n = p$ with $p$ a prime.

\question
Let $I$ and $J$ be ideals of a ring $A$. Prove that $I + J$ is the smallest ideal of $A$ containing both $I$ and $J$.

\question
Let $I$ and $J$ be ideals of a ring $A$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Prove that $IJ$ is an ideal contained in $I \cap J$.
    \item Prove that if $A$ is abelian and $I + J = A$, then $IJ = I \cap J$.
\end{enumerate}

\question
List all the homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ to $\mathbb{Z}_4$.

\question
Let $R = M_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Prove that the elements 
\[
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]
are nilpotents of $R$ whose sum is not nilpotent. Conclude then that the set of nilpotents in the noncommutative ring $M_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is not an ideal.

\question
Prove that any homomorphic image of a commutative ring is a commutative ring.

\question
The radical of $J$ is the set
\[
\operatorname{rad}(J) = \{a \in A \mid \exists n \in \mathbb{Z} : a^n \in J\}.
\]
Prove that $\operatorname{rad}(J)$ is an ideal of $A$.

\question
Let $A$ and $B$ be rings and $\eta : A \to B$ a surjective homomorphism.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Assume that $J$ is an ideal of $A$ such that $J \supseteq \ker(\eta)$. Prove that $\eta(J)$ is an ideal of $B$.
    \item Assume that $B$ is a field. Prove that $\ker(\eta)$ is a maximal ideal, i.e., it is a proper ideal which is not strictly contained in any strictly larger proper ideal.
\end{enumerate}

\question
Let $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Prove that
\[
m\mathbb{Z} + n\mathbb{Z} = \gcd(m, n)\mathbb{Z}.
\]

\question
Establish each of the following isomorphisms:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item $\mathbb{Z}_{20} / 4\mathbb{Z}_{20} \cong \mathbb{Z}_4$.
    \item $\mathbb{Z}_{12} / 6\mathbb{Z}_{12} \cong \mathbb{Z}_6$.
    \item $\mathbb{Z}_{72} / 12\mathbb{Z}_{72} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{12}$.
    \item $\mathbb{R}[x] / \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle \cong \mathbb{C}$.
\end{enumerate}

\question
Let $f : A \to B$ be a surjective homomorphism of rings, where $B$ is a commutative ring. Let $I$ be the ideal generated by elements of the form $aa' - a'a$, with $a, a' \in A$. Show that:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item $I \subseteq \ker f$.
    \item $I = \ker f$ if and only if the canonical surjection:
    \[
    A / I \to A / \ker f \cong B
    \]
    is an isomorphism.
\end{enumerate}

\question
Show that the ideal $\langle x^2 - 2 \rangle$ of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is prime but not maximal by proving that
\[
\mathbb{Z}[x] / \langle x^2 - 2 \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}].
\]

\question
Let $C[0,1]$ be the ring of continuous functions from $[0,1]$ to $\mathbb{R}$ with the structure described in Exercise 10.3.3. Show that
\[
I = \left\{f \in C[0,1] \;\bigg|\; f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 0\right\}
\]
is a maximal ideal.

\question
Let $A$ and $B$ be rings. Show that an ideal of $A \times B$ can always be written in the form $I \times J$, with $I \trianglelefteq A$ and $J \trianglelefteq B$. Deduce that an ideal of $A \times B$ is maximal if and only if it can be written as one of the forms $I \times B$, with $I$ maximal in $A$, or $A \times J$, with $J$ maximal in $B$.

\question
Let $A$ be a commutative ring and $I$ a prime ideal of $A$ such that $A/I$ is finite. Show that $I$ is maximal.

\question
Let $A$ be a commutative ring and $I$ a proper ideal of $A$. Show that $I$ is prime if and only if $A \setminus I$ is closed under multiplication.

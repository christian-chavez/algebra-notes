\question
A group $H$ is called finitely generated if there is a finite set $A$ such that $H=\langle A\rangle$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Prove that every finite group is finitely generated.
    \item Prove that $\mathbb{Z}$ is finitely generated.
    \item Prove that every finitely generated subgroup of the additive group $\mathbb{Q}$ is cyclic. (If $H$ is a finitely generated subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}$, show that $H \leq\left\langle\frac{1}{k}\right\rangle$, where $k$ is the product of all the denominators which appear in a set of generators for $H$.)
    \item Prove that $\mathbb{Q}$ is not finitely generated.
\end{enumerate}
